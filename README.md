## âœ¨ Introduction

Planning Poker is a popular Agile technique used to build consensus on effort estimates for work items. Instead of lengthy discussions, each team member privately selects a "card" representing their estimate. All cards are then revealed simultaneously. This method encourages everyone's participation and helps produce more accurate estimates.

This tool is a **personal, non-profit project** built to provide a fast, intuitive, and free solution for development teams.
